Roadmap
====

* research tor network and shadowsocks protocol to be clear it's leak
* shadowsocksR seems doing some protocol transfer and mask, may be the same purpose with me
	* dig deeper about shadowsocksR from [here](https://github.com/shadowsocksr-backup/shadowsocksr/issues/9#issuecomment-344796980)
* research lantern and psiphon
	* according to [lantern's readme](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/blob/devel/README-dev.md), it seems to be a HTTP proxy. the architecture design seems interesting.
	* [here](https://bitbucket.org/psiphon/psiphon-circumvention-system) is the repository of psiphon, the readme says it compatibility with some usually protocols.
* research gfw papers to know its mechanisms
* research fasthttp to find a way parsing http protocol
* [here](http://www.chinagfw.org/2014/05/pciosmaclinux.html) are some way to cross wall
* how does tor manage user authorization
