# jormungand

This project is just only for the very experimentation and implementation of my graduation paper which sees the network is just an objective subject to dig and analyze. I could NOT BE RESPONSIBLE for the other use, especially considering the world is so complicated to explain.

NOTICE, if this repository offends any groups' and/or individuals' right, I didn't mean it. Email me, and let me fix it.
